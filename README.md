# Sort() function
It is a built-in function of algorithm header file it is used to sort the containers like an array, vectors in a specified order. Internally this function is implemented as Quick-sort
Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large list of elements into two smaller sub-lists: the lower elements and the higher elements. Quicksort then recursively sort the sub-lists.

### sort(array, array+n);
# reverse()
reverse() is a function in algorithm header file used to reverse a sequence in the given range.
In the following example, we shall include algorithm header file and use reverse() function. Pass the beginning and ending of the string as arguments to reverse() function as shown in the program. This process reverses the string in-place.

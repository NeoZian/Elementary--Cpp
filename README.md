# Sort() function
It is a built-in function of algorithm header file it is used to sort the containers like an array, vectors in a specified order. Internally this function is implemented as Quick-sort
Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large list of elements into two smaller sub-lists: the lower elements and the higher elements. Quicksort then recursively sort the sub-lists.

### sort(array, array+n);
